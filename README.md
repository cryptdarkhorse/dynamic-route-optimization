# dynamic-route-optimization
## Overview
This project aims to optimize vehicle routes using real-time traffic, weather, and vehicle data, while calculating emissions for each route to help reduce the carbon footprint of logistics operations. The system integrates various APIs and recommends the most efficient routes.

## Features
- Real-time data from APIs like TomTom, Google Maps, AQICN, and OSRM.
- Dynamic route calculation considering traffic and weather conditions.
- Estimation of COâ‚‚ emissions for each route.
- User-friendly interface for easy route input and viewing emissions data.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/dynamic-route-optimization.git


#Machine Learning model we train for LaneSense: YOLO-Based  Optimization at Traffic Signal
###1The main idea is to examine live video feeds of traffic intersections using YOLO(You Only Look Once) algorithm.
###2The system determines the lane-specific car density by detecting and tracking vehicles.
###3Afterwards, lanes with a higher vehicle density receive green signals, which maximizes traffic flow and reduces wait times.
